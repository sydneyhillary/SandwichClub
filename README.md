# SandwichClub
Really great, because i got to research on some areas. I believe my code is great. The Json parser class is set to work with the model class, although am still not sure why i get a "null sandwhich" error!

My detail layout xml is set with a scroll view for the ingredients,placeOfOrigin and description.

First project, good, so far.
